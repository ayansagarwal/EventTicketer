           Event ticketer is a role-based event ticketing platform designed to connect event organizers with attendees. 
           It allows attendees to discover and purchase tickets for events using features like map-based searching, 
           while also enabling community interaction through an event-specific chat function. 
           For organizers, the platform provides tools to create, manage, and promote events, 
           including an AI assistant for writing descriptions and a dashboard for monitoring sales. 
           Administrators ensure the integrity of the platform by managing user roles and overseeing all event submissions.
